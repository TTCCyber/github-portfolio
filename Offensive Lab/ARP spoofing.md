# ARP SPOOFING WITH KALI LINUX AND BETTERCAP

## Objective

The ARP Spoofing project aimed to demonstrate and analyze Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) vulnerabilities through practical implementation using Kali Linux and Bettercap. The primary focus was to understand how attackers can intercept network traffic by poisoning ARP tables, allowing for man-in-the-middle attacks. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security fundamentals, ARP protocol weaknesses, and methods to detect and prevent such attacks.

## Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of ARP protocol functionality and vulnerabilities
- Proficiency in using Bettercap for network attacks and monitoring
- Ability to implement and detect man-in-the-middle attacks
- Enhanced knowledge of network traffic analysis and packet inspection
- Development of practical ethical hacking skills within controlled environments
- Understanding of mitigation techniques against ARP spoofing attacks

## Tools Used

- Kali Linux as the attacker's operating system
- Bettercap framework for ARP spoofing and network manipulation
- Wireshark for packet capture and analysis
- Terminal commands for network configuration and monitoring
- Virtual machines for creating a safe testing environment

## Steps

### 1. Environment Setup

The project began with setting up a controlled network environment consisting of three machines: an attacker running Kali Linux, and two victim machines connected to the same local network. The network was configured in a way that allowed for isolated testing without affecting external systems.

### 2. Reconnaissance Phase

Before launching the attack, reconnaissance was performed using Bettercap's network discovery capabilities to identify potential targets on the network. This included scanning for active hosts, identifying their IP and MAC addresses, and understanding the network topology.

### 3. Bettercap Configuration

Bettercap was configured on the Kali Linux machine with appropriate settings to enable ARP spoofing. The configuration included defining target hosts, setting up proxies for traffic interception, and enabling modules for credential harvesting.

### 4. Executing the ARP Spoofing Attack

The ARP spoofing attack was launched using Bettercap's ARP spoofer module. This involved sending falsified ARP messages to the victim machines, causing them to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of other hosts on the network, including the default gateway.

### 5. Traffic Interception and Analysis

Once the ARP tables were poisoned, network traffic between victim machines and the gateway was routed through the attacker's machine. Wireshark was used alongside Bettercap to capture and analyze this traffic, demonstrating how unencrypted data could be intercepted.

### 6. Credential Harvesting Demonstration

The project demonstrated how an attacker could harvest credentials from unencrypted protocols such as HTTP. When victim machines accessed websites or services without proper encryption, usernames and passwords were captured through the man-in-the-middle position.

### 7. Attack Detection Methods

Various methods for detecting ARP spoofing attacks were explored, including monitoring for unusual ARP traffic, checking for duplicate IP addresses with different MAC addresses, and using tools specifically designed to alert on ARP table modifications.

### 8. Mitigation Strategies Implementation

The final phase involved implementing and testing various mitigation strategies, including static ARP entries, encryption protocols (HTTPS, SSH), network segmentation, and the use of ARP spoofing detection tools to prevent such attacks in production environments.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable hands-on experience with ARP spoofing techniques using Kali Linux and Bettercap. By understanding how these attacks work in a controlled environment, it became possible to better appreciate network vulnerabilities and develop more effective security strategies. The skills gained through this project are directly applicable to network security assessments, penetration testing, and defensive security operations.
