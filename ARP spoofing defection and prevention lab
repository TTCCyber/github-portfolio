# ARP Spoofing Detection & Prevention Lab

A comprehensive project demonstrating ARP spoofing attacks using Bettercap on Kali Linux, along with detection and prevention techniques.

## 📋 Overview

This project simulates Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks in a controlled environment to explore network vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and defensive countermeasures. The lab provides hands-on experience with network security concepts, packet manipulation, and traffic analysis.
