## Professional Statements
I am Tak-Tsun Chan, a Master of Cybersecurity candidate at La Trobe University with hands-on experience in technology risk assessment, security framework implementation, and stakeholder engagement. Currently serving as a Cyber Security Officer intern at Whittlesea Community Connections, I conduct comprehensive technology risk assessments and develop strategic recommendations for security improvements aligned with business objectives.
My experience includes implementing cybersecurity policies, procedures, and tools in alignment with the Essential Eight framework, as well as developing and delivering security awareness training programs that effectively communicate complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. Prior to this, I worked as a Community Relations Officer at The Hong Kong Jockey Club, where I performed strategic risk analyses and compliance assessments, producing comprehensive reports for executive decision-making.
My technical skills span security frameworks (Essential Eight, NIST CSF, ISO 27001), security tools (Splunk, Wireshark, Nmap, OpenVAS, Metasploit), and programming languages (Python, PHP, HTML, CSS). I hold several industry certifications including CompTIA Security+, ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC), Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, and Google IT Support Professional Certificate.
With a strong academic background (current WAM: 84.5 in my Master of Cybersecurity), fluency in multiple languages (Cantonese, English, and Mandarin), and a commitment to continuous learning, I aim to contribute to the cybersecurity field by analyzing complex technical environments and delivering practical security solutions while maintaining strong stakeholder relationships.

## Portfolio
