# ARP SPOOFING WITH KALI LINUX AND BETTERCAP

## Objective

The ARP Spoofing project aimed to demonstrate and analyze Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) vulnerabilities through practical implementation using Kali Linux and Bettercap. The primary focus was to understand how attackers can intercept network traffic by poisoning ARP tables, allowing for man-in-the-middle attacks. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security fundamentals, ARP protocol weaknesses, and methods to detect and prevent such attacks.

## Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of ARP protocol functionality and vulnerabilities
- Proficiency in using Bettercap for network attacks and monitoring
- Ability to implement and detect man-in-the-middle attacks
- Enhanced knowledge of network traffic analysis and packet inspection
- Development of practical ethical hacking skills within controlled environments
- Understanding of mitigation techniques against ARP spoofing attacks

## Tools Used

- Kali Linux as the attacker's operating system
- Bettercap framework for ARP spoofing and network manipulation
- Wireshark for packet capture and analysis
- Terminal commands for network configuration and monitoring
- Virtual machines for creating a safe testing environment

## Steps

### 1. Environment Setup

The project began with setting up a controlled network environment consisting of three machines: an attacker running Kali Linux, and two victim machines connected to the same local network. The network was configured in a way that allowed for isolated testing without affecting external systems.

```bash
# Check network interface
ifconfig

# Verify network connectivity
ping -c 3 192.168.1.1

# Scan local network to identify hosts
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
